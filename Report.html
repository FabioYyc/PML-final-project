<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal
activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who 
take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks.
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 
In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were
asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available 
from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).</p>

<h1 id="prediction">Prediction</h1>

<p>Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell 
Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), 
lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).</p>

<p>Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes.</p>

<p>After removing variables which all the values are NAs, we still find many variables has very few
values, we need to remove those predictors with near zero variance functions
remove the columns are not related to making predictions
*The training set was sampled down to to 2000 rows because the computing power of my pc</p>

<p>Out of sample error of the model =1- accuracy =1 -0.93 =0.07=7%
However, due to small sample size for training the model, the error will be larger </p>
